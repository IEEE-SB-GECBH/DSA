## Divide and conquer algorithm

In ***divide and conquer approach***, a problem is divided into smaller problems, then the smaller problems are solved independently, and finally the solutions of smaller problems are combined into a solution for the large problem.

Generally, divide-and-conquer algorithms have three parts âˆ’

Divide the problem into a number of sub-problems that are smaller instances of the same problem.

Conquer the sub-problems by solving them recursively. If they are small enough, solve the sub-problems as base cases.

Combine the solutions to the sub-problems into the solution for the original problem.
